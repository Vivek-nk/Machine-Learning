# Fraud Detection 

### Aim: 
This projects aims in detecting fradulent e-commerce transactions happening at a bank named CoinBank by analyzing the transaction log files. 

Assume that we are the Data Scientist at Coin Bank :D !!! Lets do this gruesome task !!!!

### Dataset:

#### Set A
Set-A.X.csv : contains information regarding the 94682 transactions.

Set-A.y.csv : target labels for each of the transaction found in the corresponding Set-A.X.csv dataset, 0 for legitimate and 1 for fraudulent.

#### Set-B

Set-B.X.csv : contains information regarding the 100,000 transactions, with slightly modified set of variables (custAttr1, and custAttr2).

Set-B.y.csv : target labels for each of the transaction found in the corresponding Set-B.X.csv dataset, 0 for legitimate and 1 for fraudulent.

Some note on the datasets
• Treat fraudulent transaction as “positive” and legitimate as “negative” sample.
• Due to privacy reasons, the dataset the data fields are renamed to some abstract names. Therefore, treat each field equally without giving any preference to any field in the dataset.
